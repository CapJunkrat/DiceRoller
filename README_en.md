DiceRoller is an Android app for rolling dice, designed for tabletop and RPG players who need quick dice rolls and session records.

Project description:
- Supports standard dice notation (e.g. `2d6+3`, `d20`, `1d100-5`) with formula parsing and calculation.
- Supports Advantage / Disadvantage roll modes (roll twice, take higher/lower).
- Provides saved "Action Cards" (preset formulas) and mutable system dice (change count/modifier for D6/D20, etc.).
- Session management and roll history saved locally using Room database.
- Multiple visual dice styles and simple roll animations; breakdown of roll details is shown.
- Integrated rewarded ads via AdMob for optional incentivized actions.
